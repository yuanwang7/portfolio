									At the beginning of the semester, I found a dataset called "Registered Get Started Clubs", which has a lot of records and information about 
									the different sports organisation for children,
									which can be used to build a website for children. After researching the possible target users and similar websites,
									 I propose some primary functionalities that can fit the website topic. For example. Physical activity measurements, activity visualisation, 
									, sports video, and sports recommendation. I  developed digital prototypes for all web pages.
									The prototype samples is shown below while the persona is shown in the next page.

									Part A of the team project was successful since the group has successfully decided an exciting web project with appropriate interface design.
									However, some areas need to be improved during part A process. The first area that needs to be improved is the team formation. 
									The team does not have any Interactive design students.
									However, it also forces me to learn more stuff about design, such as user testing and incorporating some design principles. 
									Secondly, when brainstorming the ideas, I focus too much on the dataset and what can I do with the dataset, which restricts my creativity. 
									Instead, I should come out with more interactive ideas, such as games. Then, finding some dataset that could fit into this game.

						<p class="para_heading">Part B Challenges</p>
						<p> 
								One of the significant challenges is that the dataset does not contain latitude and longitude of the
								 sports organisation. However, the google map API requires longitude and latitude to locate the organisation on the map.
						</p>
						<p>
								For the sports activity visualisation, there is a lot of technology for me to learn. For example, How to connect the chart with the database,how to dynmacially change the chart when he data in the backend has been changed?
								 How to build the database? How to obtain some meaning data for the useful such as total duration of activity.  How to display data interactivly?
								In addition, As a team leader, I have to make sure each team member has accomplished  equal amount of work and implement the MVP so that the website 
								has basic functionality before partB demonstration.
							
						</p>
					</div>
					<div class="row">
						<p class="para_heading">Part B Process </p>
						<p> 
								
								Overall, I have designed and developed the visualisation of the user sports activity. For example, the total time of physical activty which is shown on the bar chart.
								 Also, I designed a BMI chart for a user to check out their BMI changes over a year. In addition, the doughnut chart shows different sports user played over the years.
                            
								First, I did some research about the competitive APIs of the chart visualisation. I tried the Google chart first. 
								However, I found that Chart.js is more responsive. Therefore. I switched to Chart.js API.
							   Since one of the challenges is the update the chart dynamically, therefore, I have to build a database with corresponding attributes and records.
								 To obtain the total duration, I used aggregation SQL statement such as SUM. 
								 To make a chart changed automatically, I used AJAX. First, I wrote a PHP file which aggregates data from Mysql. Then, using Ajax to call the PHP file. 
								Then I started implementing the map interaction.
							   One of the features is to locate the club on the map. However, there is no longitude and latitude information, which I can not mark them on the map directly. 
							   Thanks for the tutor's help, I tried Google geocode, which can get the longitude and latitude. The sports filter implementation is not very time consuming because I have learned 
							   similar functionality
							    during the workshop.

						<p class="para_heading">Part B Reflection</p>
						<p> 
								The partB is successful. The primary functionalities of the proposed design have been accomplished before Week 9. However, the
								 aesthetics, interactions and workflow were not good. For example, based on week 9's feedback, 
								the user might confuse about what those button does, and how can the user goes from search page to visualisation page. 
								Therefore, the website should provide feedback.  For example, how to inform the user about the function of the buttons, when the user hovers the button.
								There are some lessons I learned after this part. I should research on how to implement the website when proposing the idea to test the feasibility of the function. Because 
								I  spent a lot of time implementing the map interaction due to the challenge that there is no latitude and longitude information on the dataset,

							<p class="para_heading">Part C challenges</p>
							<p>
									The group encounter several challenges after part B
									First, the 'The registered Get Started the Queensland Government
									 has removed Club' API. That means, the group must find another similar dataset or change the website ideal.
									  In addition, there are only a few valid records for this dataset. Therefore, the search interaction has to be changed correspondingly. 
								
							</p>
							
						</div>

					<div class="row">
							<p class="para_heading">Part C Process</p>
							<p>
									Based on the user testing result, I have added the tooltips for navigation items. Therefore, when the user hovers the navigation button, a message about what the button does will show up. 
									During Week10, the original dataset "Get Started registered clubs" API has been removed by Queensland Government. Fortunately,  I found another similar dataset called "State sport and recreation organisations".  However, 
									there are only a few records for this dataset. I have to remove the suburb filter since there is only a few organisation for each sport, and only a few suburbs have an organisation on that dataset
									There would be no result if filtering the suburbs. In addition, to add more interactions into the map. I have developed a navigation button which calls the google direction service.
									Based on the survey, many users think that BMI is essential for them. In addition, I have developed a BMI chart during PartB. Therefore, I develop a BMI calculates page, which 
									the user can get BMI by entering height and weight. The historical BMI data can be viewed in the visualisation page.

									<li>Get started Sports Club search</li>
									<li>upcoming Firework event</li>

							<p>
								
									Eventually, The individual idea is to design the Get started sports club search website. 
									The dataset I use is called 'get stated club.'
									The reason I choose the Get started clubs is several interactions and functionalities are interesting, and the web application can be useful to the 
									target users.
									Since my individual idea is chosen to be the team project idea, I will not talk about the process because most of them have been mentioned in the PartA.

									This is my first time to develop a web-based portfolio. I use the Fullpage js to help manage the one-page website layout.
									Also, I use bootstrap carousel and modal plugins to manage the picture layout. By using a carousel, I can save a lot of space for the image.
									Those plugin references are shown in the reference section.
									I think it is essential to keep the writing and layout clear. Therefore, I use the fixed horizontal navigation bar so that the reader can move to a different section on any page. 
									For the content pages, I  use the white background color and black font for high contrast which is easier to read.

									After completing the group project, I have not only learned about Javascript and PHP but also some useful APIs such as 
									ChartJS, Google Chart and Google map. 
								
									During the project implementation, I have improved my debugging skills. I think it is beneficial to 
									use console and alert to find some logic errors and tricky bugs.
									I learned some useful design principles and some user evaluation, which are excellent methods to improve web design. 
									During developing and changing the website, I learned how important feedback for the user. It is essential to provide information about each button, When
									the website has many buttons functions..

								After finishing the course, most of the expectation has been met, and I am very exciting to devleoping those skills and become more confident on web design and 
								development. As a team learder, I also learned some communication and team organsation skills. For example, how to manage the project by setting some milestones.

								The skills I gained during the course are not only programming but also how to solve problems such as team communication and how to find the bug and solve them.

									Most of the expectation is met after completing the final project. I gained some design experience, such as using Photoshop and Adobe Illustration, when designing the individual proposed web design.
									 I learned many useful web technologies such as AJAX and PHP which connect 
									the frontend with the database so that user's data can be shown and updated on the front end, which is very practical and useful.
									I also gained some experience in user testing and survey, which are very factors for building a usable website.
									I also learned some design principles during the project. I incorporate this principle, such as feedback during group project designing. I am going to keep developing those design
									 and development skills.
								I am gonna keep developing those design and development skills

							<p> 
									Overall, this is a great course. The professor and tutors are helpful. The process will be very frustrating if one of the members did not make enough effort or does not care about the course. Therefore, I suggested that the group project can be changed into an individual project, 
									which is fair for every student. Also, each student can learn more about web design and development.
								
							</p>
							<p> 
									In addition, the group project started in week 8. The group formation begins at week six and presenting the group project on week 8. That means, there are only four weeks left
									For the group implementing the whole project. Therefore, it is better to let the group start the group project near the beginning of the semester so that there will be 
									enough time for each group to collect user feedback and change the design based on that feedback.
